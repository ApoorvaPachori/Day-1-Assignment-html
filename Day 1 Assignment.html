       <h1> DEVOPS </h1>
       <h3> <p>DevOps is another abbreviation you’re bound to hear more and more often these days. What it essentially stands for is the combination of software development and information technology operations. DevOps is a set of practices that aim to optimize or shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features and updates in close alignment with business objectives. DevOps preaches the use of a different set of tools, called toolchains, to achieve these objectives.
        DevOps Teams use practices to automate processes that traditionally have been slow or manual. They use tools and stacks that enable them to develop and evolve applications quickly and reliably.</p> </h3>

       <h3> <p>
            DevOps has strong affinities with Agile and Lean approaches. The old view of operations tended towards the “Dev” side being the “makers” and the “Ops” side being the “people that deal with the creation after its birth” 
             the realization of the harm that has been done in the industry of those two being treated as siloed concerns is the core driver behind DevOps. In this way, DevOps can be interpreted as an outgrowth of Agile 
             agile software development prescribes close collaboration of customers, product management, developers, and (sometimes) QA to fill in the gaps and rapidly iterate towards a better product   </p> </h3>

             <h3> <p> There’s not one path to DevOps – there’s just what works in your organization.  Very successful DevOps initiatives have been originated from dev teams and from ops teams, top down and bottom up, from inside the company and from consultants, with widespread education and with skunkwork pilots.  Therefore it’s hard to give a generic playbook for how you can get it implemented. I think it’s safe to say that it starts with you yourself learning about the values, principles, methods, and practices of DevOps and trying to spread it via whatever channel is most effective – telling fellow techies, getting management buyin, just starting to implement things in a more DevOps way  yourself and letting success speak for itself…  People will try to tell you how things can rise to success in your org, but that advice is usually more policy and wishful thinking than reality.  Observe how other popular things in your organization have arisen and gained currency and try those same channels. And keep learning.    </p>   </h3>
